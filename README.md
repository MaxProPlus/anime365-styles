### How to install

You'll need a browser extension that supports userstyles, the one I use (and the one the style is written and tested with) is Stylus. Download it here for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)

Then you can add the style to Stylus by opening the raw .user.css file of the style. The master branch contains the stable versions, and the development versions are in the style's respective branches.
Most styles have many customisation settings, so you can customize the style without even looking into the code too!
